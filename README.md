# Features
## Existing Features:

**Google Maps API**

**Bootstrap Carousel API**

**Contact form via EmailJS API** 


## Features left to implement
**Find your dream location quiz:** 

Users can answer a series of questions that provide multiple choice answers. Depending on the answers selected by the user, the quiz will generate their ideal holiday destination and redirect them to the locations page.  

**Sky Scanner API:**

The integration of the Sky Scanner API into the site is contingent on the reopening of international borders and the decrease of travel bans globally. Given the prevalence of COVID-19 globally and it's effects on international travel, the site owner has decided to delay the integration of the Sky Scanner API, until such a time, that international travel is less restricted and that the inclusion of the API will provide additional value for the user. Until then, it's integration has been tabled for a future release.
