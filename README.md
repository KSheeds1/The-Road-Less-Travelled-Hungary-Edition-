# Features
## Existing Features:

**Navigation Bar:**

* Fixed in the default position, allowing users to quickly identify the different sections of the site. On mobile screen widths, these sections are available in a collapsible menu to provide a cleaner layout on smaller screens. 

**Google Maps API:**

* To provide users with a more interactive experience, each location HTML page includes a map of the destination where users can view all amenities available in the area. 
With user interaction and engagement in mind, a site visitor can simply toggle between the amenities on the map using the radio buttons placed above the map. 

**Bootstrap Carousel API:**

* An image carousel has been added to the landing page and each destination page, to draw site users in, presenting images of the destinations advertised on the site will encourage further interaction and exploration of the site. 

**Contact form via EmailJS API:** 

* With the integration of EMAILJS API, users can get in touch with The Road Less Travelled team, with any questions they may have by simply filling out the form found on the contact page, improving the overall user experience and a custom service and satisfaction.

**Social media links:**

* Links to The Road Less Travelled social media accounts will be provided in the footer of the site. This allows for further engagement with current site visitors , as well as providing an opportunity to endorse and advertise the website to a diverse demographic of users across several platforms, in the aim of increase web traffic. 


## Features left to implement:

For future releases, the aim is to expand the site to include other countries to offer an even larger variety of holiday destinations located in Eastern Europe. Finally categorising this content as "The Eastern Europe Edition". This would see the implementation of new features such as:

**Filter option for destinations:**

* The developer intends to implement a filter option throughout the site, allowing the users to search destinations by price, locations, seasonal getaways, and package holidays. 

**Find your dream location quiz:** 

* Users can answer a series of questions that provide multiple choice answers. Depending on the answers selected by the user, the quiz will generate their ideal holiday destination and redirect them to the locations page.  

**The inclusion of relevant APIs:**

* The integration of a variety of APIs accommodation such as Trivago and Booking.com, currency conversion, as well as transport, including Flexibus and SkyScanner. The integration of the Sky Scanner API into the site is contingent on the reopening of international borders and the decrease of travel bans globally. 
Given the prevalence of COVID-19 globally and it's effects on international travel, the site owner has decided to delay the integration of the Sky Scanner API, until such a time, that international travel is less restricted and that the inclusion of the API will provide additional value for the user. Until then, it's integration has been tabled for a future release.
These APIs would provide the users with the ability to book all elements of their trip from the one site, while also allowing them to research the location and its amenities at the same time. 


**Implementation of live chat software:**

* To provide website users with an alternative method of communication with The Road Less Travelled team in real time, via chat windows. The implementation of live chat software will provide a quicker means of communication with users compared to email, whilst improving user interaction and satisfaction. 
The owner goal is to be able to provide users with any additional information they may need as quickly as possible to maintain visitor engagement with the site. The addition of live chat software will help achieve this goal.

# Testing

## Bugs discovered and resolved during development:
**Markers as links** 

In an effort to create a more interactive website, the developer aimed to create a map where the markers could be used to redirect the user to other pages of the site, about different locations in Hungary, depending on which marker was clicked.
The developer created an array "markerLocations" containing several keys of information on each location, including the URL for each location page. 
The URL was passed in the for loop within the initialisation of initMap to call and create the markers located on the map found on index.html. 
To achieve the desired functionality, an event listener was added to the markers, listening for a click event, triggering window.location.href property which created a pathway to redirect the user to the HTML page of the markers location. 


**Multiple maps and creating markers**

The developer chose to initialise the maps separately, creating an initialise function for each maP. However, upon creating of the fifth and final map a bug was found. 
Four of the location maps were initialised and set up to display the request of restaurant to trial the functionality of the maps. Each map was initialised one at a time and checked to make sure that each map was displaying markers as another map was added. 
Following the initialisation of the final map, all markers from all maps bar the final map had disappeared. The error being thrown in the console referencing the final map initialised. 
Upon further inspection, the bug was narrowed down to the "createMarker" functions, as the developer chose to initialise the maps separately, each contained their own "createMarker" function which effectively led to the function being redefined each time. 
This clarified why the markers were only displaying on the last map initialised. In order to correct this, the developer chose to declare a global variable "currentMap" and assign each map to it within the initialisation functions. 
Each callback function was moved inside the initialisation functions, where the createMarker function was called, passing the results as a parameter.
While this resolved the issue and the markers were displaying on each map, a new error was thrown, indicating there was an issue with the order in which elements were being loaded. Further inspection led to the removal of the "onload=initMaps" attribute from the body tag of index.html. 
This attribute attempted to load the map div, which had not been created at the time.     


**EmailJS**

The developer initially set up the EmailJS API using the steps outlined in the walkthrough video for the EmailJS lesson from the interactive frontend module and gained functionality. 
However, this functionality was short lived and began throwing errors in the console, surrounding a HTTP status code 400 - bad request, which translated to an issue with the user ID, necessary for the initialisation of the API. 
Although the user ID was previously initialised during the init method, the developer added it to the function in an attempt to resolve the bug, but this was not successful. In an effort to resolve this, the function put in place was replaced, in line with the documentation outlined on the dashboard of EmailJS for such status codes. 
The addition of an error/success console.log provided more information. Throwing a HTTP status code 200, this clarified that the account was indeed linked to the site however it still threw a status code 400 for a bad request, requiring the user ID. 
While attempting to debug the issue, it was noticed that parts pf the HTML for the form was set up in line with the older version of EmailJS, this was altered inline with the documentation, as well as the javascript file "sendEmail.js" being altered using the newer version of "email.sendForm" method to collect the values of the form and pass them to the specified template, with the method returning the promise. 
This finally cleared the status code 400 and functionality was established.
